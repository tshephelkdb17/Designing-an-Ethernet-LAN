# Designing-an-Ethernet-LAN

Project Title: Ethernet LAN Design for Fictional Organisation
Course: Bachelor of Information Technology (Network and Systems Computing)
Assessment Type: Group Project
Tools Used: Cisco Packet Tracer, Microsoft Word/Visio/Draw.io (for diagram)

  üìå Project Overview:
This project involved the design and documentation of a small-scale wired Ethernet LAN based on a fictional organisation's requirements. The organisation needed a secure, scalable, and well-structured network to support its internal operations.

  üë®‚Äçüíª My Contributions:
Analysed the case study and identified the organisation‚Äôs networking requirements.
Designed a star topology for efficient layout and troubleshooting.
Performed IP address allocation using subnetting.
Selected and configured switches, routers, and wireless access points in Cisco Packet Tracer.
Implemented basic security measures, including:
VLAN configuration
Port security
Password protection on devices
Created a detailed network topology diagram and project documentation.
Wrote the justification report explaining design decisions and alignment with organisational goals

  üè•Public Area Network ‚Äì Tasks Completed
Designed and implemented separate subnets for:
#Reception
#Guest/Waiting Area
#Cafeteria
#Security
Applied VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking) to allocate efficient IP ranges for each zone.
Assigned IP addresses to all end devices, including PCs, IP phones, printers, CCTV cameras, and self-service kiosks.
Connected Access Points (APs) for wireless coverage and integrated them with a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC).
Configured VLANs for public access zones to segment traffic securely.
Connected POS terminals and digital signage screens to relevant switches and assigned static IPs where necessary.
Configured router interfaces (e.g., G0/0 to G0/4) for each subnet and tested interconnectivity.
Verified proper DHCP assignment, RIP routing updates, and device communication across the Public Area.
Documented the subnet table, router interface table, and updated IP addressing in the project report.
Ensured future scalability by reserving spare IP addresses in each public subnet.
